		bio: [
			'I\'m a full stack developer who believes great software should feel invisible. I focus on building fast, intuitive, and seamless user experiences using modern JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, Next.js, and Node.js.',
			'My journey began at a tech firm in Lahore where I started with Vue.js and learned that the best interfaces are the ones users do not have to think about. Since then I have contributed to applications that improved engagement, increased conversions, and delivered clean and high quality user experiences.',
			'Over time I have specialized in crafting pixel perfect UIs, integrating REST APIs, optimizing performance, and building maintainable architectures using TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN, and modern tooling. I enjoy designing components, refining user flows, and making products feel polished and responsive.',
			'When I am not coding you will probably find me experimenting with new frameworks, improving past projects, or helping others in the developer community. I believe in clean code, ethical development, and continuous learning because great products come from collaboration, curiosity, and attention to detail.'
